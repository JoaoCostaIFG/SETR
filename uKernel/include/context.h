 * Macro to save all the general purpose registers, the save the stack pointer
 * into the TCB.
 *
 * The first thing we do is save the flags then disable interrupts.  This is to
 * guard our stack against having a context switch interrupt after we have already
 * pushed the registers onto the stack - causing the 32 registers to be on the
 * stack twice.
 *
 * r1 is set to zero as the compiler expects it to be thus, however some
 * of the math routines make use of R1.
 *
 * The interrupts will have been disabled during the call to portSAVE_CONTEXT()
 * so we need not worry about reading/writing to the stack pointer.
